Marriage advice from an imperfect husband

I may not do it all well, but I try 🤷‍♂️😁

Sometimes she just needs an ear. As guys, we want to fix problems. But sometimes she just wants you to listen without talking or trying to fix it. She may not need it fixed. She may just need to vent. If you're not sure, ask, "Do You want solutions? Or do you just need an ear?"

During an argument don't get defensive. It's hard, but worth it

Shut up & listen to her. Ask questions to understand how she feels and WHY

Do everything you can to put yourself in her shoes. To truly understand her. Then explain how you feel with that context in mind.

Make time for date nights even when life is crazy

Make sure you can be honest with each other especially about the hard things

Make sure you can communicate with each other about hard things

She's your number one priority now. If she says you're spending too much time doing X. The two of you need to have a deep conversation about the gap in your feelings & come to a compromise. Make sure one person is not always dominating (winning out in) the compromises

You are a team. There will be times in your life where external circumstances dump a load in one of your laps. It's the job of the other to lighten the normal load of life by taking on more of the normal duties. It's hard for both of you. It's not a contest ->

Persevere because of each other, not in spite of each other.

Periodic check-ins. Whether monthly or quarterly, make sure things are not slipping. Make sure there aren't building resentments the other doesn't know about.

Consider the check-ins your relationships oil change. The date nights are like the weekly gas fill ups. They give energy to the relationship

Daily: Tell her she's beautiful. Tell her you love her. Hug and cuddle her. Kiss her. Even if you only see each other for one minute that day. Surprise her with flowers, but also surprise her by doing her chores sometimes. As you get older, that'll be what she loves

Read the book Eight Dates together, go on the dates, and discuss the topics. It'll be well worth the time.
