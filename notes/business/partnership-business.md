# Questions for Andrew:
Is the return on investment in real estate enough that it makes sense for us to get into it with the capital we have available? Or does a business make more sense? Especially in terms of being able to grow and scale


with the amount of money we decide on, would he go for a business or real estate and why?


If business, what kind of business? Thoughts on laundromats?


Basic cost to owning a multi-lease property? Time requirements on a weekly/monthly basis?


Do you think a partnership makes sense?

What's your recommended company structure?

# Questions for partnership

What are we as individuals looking for?
Does it make sense to form this group? As in, are our goals aligned?

Do we want passive income or active?

What are your preferred business ideas and income streams?

Do you plan on taking money out immediately or letting it ride to continue building?
- Note: if some want to let it ride and others want to take money out, we need to figure out how to structure that so that any future deals/income streams are adjusted for funds left for growth

How do you picture this business venture progressing?

Where do you see this in 5/10/20 years?

## Later questions
How do we handle disagreements on capital allocation?

How do we handle it if someone wants to "break a rule"? Such as pull their capital early or during a deal?

How are we accounting for time spent? If one person is handling the majority of the deal making / paperwork / phone calls... What's the worth and how are they paid for it?
