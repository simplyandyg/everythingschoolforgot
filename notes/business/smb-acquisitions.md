Over the next 25 years, Boomers are going to be transferring a lot of wealth to Millennials

12 million small and medium businesses will change hands - roughly worth a combined $10 trillion

It's estimated that 70% of those businesses will be sold to unrelated, third party people by 2028

Businesses with less than $2M in earnings usually sell for 2.5-5 x earnings

So a business earning $1M will generally sell for $2.5-5M

Where to get the money? The Small Business Administration (SBA), supports loans through its 7(a) program for exactly these purposes. Some loans can be grabbed for as little as 5% down

In theory, that means buying a business with $1M in earnings for as little as $125k
