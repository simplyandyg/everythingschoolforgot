# dealing with tantrums and difficult kids
## When they are being difficult:
### Quick summary
1. Remember that everything with kids takes longer than you'd like
2. Acknowledge their feelings
3. Empathize with them by saying you experience similar feelings sometimes
4. Explain to them the reason why their actions were not ideal or the preferred way to handle a situation
	1. E.g. "instead of pushing your sister when she plays with our toys. If it makes You really mad then tell Mommy and daddy that you need help with handling your sister"
5. Try to be playful
	1. "Mr. Nail clipper is hungry"
	2. "Let's be dinosaurs and see who can get in the car first"
6. Give them options
	1. Don't make the options a threat
7. Let the child be in charge
8. Try to give information instead of a direct order
9. Use a single word
10. Describe what you see
11. Describe how you feel

### Longer explanation
1. Acknowledge their feelings
	1. E.g. "I understand it makes you mad when your sister plays with your toys. Sharing can be hard."
	2. Be dramatic and silly want it
		1. "I bet you would keep all your toys hidden forever of you could. Like a troll under a bridge. My toys! Mine!"
		2. "I bet you would eat cookies all the time. If you could. Cookies for breakfast cookies for dinner cookies for lunch cookies for bedtime snack. I bet you would sleep on a giant cookie. Would you surf on a cookie. Use a cookie as a skateboard. Put little cookies on the bottom of your roller skates. Use cookies for your bike tires. Use cookies for the car tires and then eat them"
2. It may also help to empathize with their feelings
	1. EG "I know you want a cookie before dinner. I would love have to have a cookie too. It can be hard to not have snacks before dinner. Especially when we're really hungry"
	2. Don't only say "I know you're angry". Try to match their emotion and energy
	3. Don't patronize them. Acknowledge their feelings in the same way you would do to a friend
3. Try to help them get past the feelings and issues they are stuck on
	1. With writing:
		1. Using the cookie example: write "cookie" on a piece of paper and hand it to them
	2. With art:
		1. Back to the cookie example. Draw a cookie on a piece of paper and say "here's a cookie. We can even add some things to it so it's even more yummy. And then draw the things that your child like to add to it."
		2. "Why don't you draw me a picture of a yummy cookie"
		3. "Why don't you draw me a cookie of what makes you hate school so much that you don't want to go"
	3. With music?
		1. Maybe sing a song about how you also want a cookie and how great it would be to have a cookie. However we have to wait until after dinner
	4. With fantasy and imagination
		1. "You lost your penny? I wish I had a button right here that could give you a million billion pennies. And they would all fall down bright on you. Splat. And then you would have so many pennies that you could swim in them. Would you like that? What else would you like?"
4. Questioning the child, even innocently could be overwhelming to the child. Or they may simply not want to or know how to express themselves sufficiently
5. Try to be playful
	1. "Mr. Nail clipper is hungry"
	2. "Let's be dinosaurs and see who can get in the car first"
6. Give them options
	1. Don't make the options a threat
	2. You don't need to give the child options on the action that is not negotiable.
	3. You can give them options on something leading up to that action or on something different entirely
	4. E. G. "Do you want to take a snack or a toy for the ride in the car?"
	5. "Would you like to take cookies or carrots as a snack for the car ride?"
	6. "We need to get dressed. Would you like to wear blue socks or red socks?"
	7. "What books do you want to read after we take a tub?"
	8. "Do you want to play with your car toy or your truck toy after we get dressed?"
7. Let the child be in charge
	1. Make a temperature chart with pictures of the clothing you wear at that specified temperature. Then the child can look at the chart and make the decision on what the appropriate clothing is based on the temperature of the day
8. Try to give information instead of a direct order
	1. Instead of "put your seatbelt on now", say "the law says we can't leave until everyone has on their seatbelt"
	2. Instead of "stop banging that glass on the table", say "if glass bangs on the table it might break and the pieces could be sharp and cut someone"
9. Use a single noun
	1. "Shoes"
		1. As in "take your shoes off when you come into the house"
		2. But when you only say the word and not give the order, you are forcing your child to think and therefore make the decision on their own. But what they are supposed to do instead of being told to do it
10. Describe what you see
	1. Be sure to mention any progress first
		1. Quote I notice half the blocks are cleaned up. Looks like they're still another half on the floor
11. Describe how you feel
	1. Describing how you feel gives them words that they can add to their vocabulary to describe how they feel
	2. It also teaches them to emulate the behavior of explaining how they feel instead of showing it through something like yelling or getting angry


## When they are crossing the line and you feel they need consequences or punishment
1. Strongly express how you feel
	1. I don't want you hitting your sister.
	2. I do not like when kids hit other kids.
		1. Sometimes it can help to be indirect because then it does not feel like a verbal/character attack on them as an individual
		2. However, other books say to be specific so I'm not sure which is better
2. Explain how their actions made others feel and show them how they can make amends and apologize
	1. When you pushed your sister on the slide it made her really scared and upset. Do you want to bring her a bucket to play in the sand with? That? Might cheer her up
2. Offer them a choice
	1. I can see you're having trouble taking your time and taking turns on the slide. So you can go on the swings or you can go in the sandbox
2. Take action
	1. It helps to view this as taking action to protect them or others
	2. If they are refusing to stop hitting other children then they have to leave the park because it is not safe for the other kids
	3. If they are refusing to stay with you in the parking lot then they may have to sit in the stroller because it is to protect them
	4. If they are not using a certain toy properly, you may have to take it away so that they do not get hurt or a friend does not get hurt
	5. It's not just about protecting people. It can also be about protecting things. I'm going to take this toy away now because it was expensive and we don't want it to get broken. We can play with a different toy that was cheaper or as tougher and will not break
	6. Or protecting yourself from stressful situations or high emotional situations. We're not going back to the park until we figure out how we can manage to ensure no one else is going to get hurt and we come up with a better plan for how to manage your emotions when we are there. Because it's just too stressful for me to deal with you hurting other children.
	7. It's a focus on safety and peace of mind for the present in solutions for the future
	8. "I can't allow throwing of the blocks so unfortunately I'm going to have to put them away now"
	9. "I can't let books be pushed off the shelf. So we're going to have to leave the library."
	10. "I can't let food be smeared all over the kitchen counter. So I'm going to put it away now."
	11. These examples are both separating in the name of safety and health, including mental health. It's not about trying to make the child uncomfortable, inflict discomfort, or inflict pain. Pain. It's about creating a safe environment for the child and the people and things around them
3. Try problem solving - with the child
	1. Once things have calmed down and you feel the child may be receptive to talking. You can bring up the incident again
	2. "I noticed you get really mad when you have to wait for your little sister to go down the slide because sometimes she can take a long time to muster up the courage. And it seems like that makes you quite angry"
	3. Listen to see if they have anything to say or add to this
	4. If they do, make sure to take it seriously and use it as part of your problem solving plan
	5. Next, bring up your feelings and those feelings of the other people who may have been affected by whatever happened
		1. Make this part short and sweet. If you drone on and on, you'll lose their attention
	6. "The librarian was not very happy that you kept pull off of her shelf, especially after he cleaned them up"
	7. Ask their ideas on how to fix or deal with this problem
		1. "We need some ideas so we can go back to the park without anyone getting hurt"
		2. Allow ridiculous and silly ideas
		3. Don't reject ideas right away
		4. "Put a sign on the slide that says NO Babies!"
		5. "If the slide is crowded, play on something else"
	8. Write all the ideas down
	9. Work your through the ideas. Gently explaining why some may not work.
	10. Write down your solution, and put it on the fridge
	11. Bring your list and solutions with you so you can try them out together.
		1. Having the list of solutions physically with you may excite them. They may be happy and excited to try the solutions they helped come up with
		2. If it doesn't work, it's time to go back to the drawing board
	3. A simpler approach to problem solving with your child, is to ask them. Them? "What can we do to fix this?" when something has gone wrong or they notice something is wrong. Instead of telling them what to do or how they should fix it
