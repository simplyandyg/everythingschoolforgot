Hi, I’m Andy.

Dad. Husband. Software engineer.

I'm mainly writing for my kids about the important lessons I wish someone would have spelled out for me. This site will mostly be a collection of introductions to important topics and life lessons. There’s so much that I want them to know and understand about the world.

Many of the articles cover complex topics that I do not claim to be an expert in. I expect I’ll make mistakes in the articles, which I plan to revise as I continue to learn.
