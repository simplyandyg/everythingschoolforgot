In today's society, we love telling everyone how they can be "better". We tell people "the right way" to do everything. We tell them they need to be happier, more outgoing. They need to push themselves always. They aren't good enough the way they are. We need to do everything the best way. We need to optimize and be as efficient as possible, anything else is less than. 

It has even gotten to the point where many struggle to simply converse and have discussions over topics that should be cause for friendly debate. But as a society we've begun to convince ourselves that there's always only one right answer, one right way to do something. But as we all know, in practical application, that is not the case.

Differences are what makes life interesting.

Differences are what allow creativity, new ideas, and progress.

It's okay to be sad sometimes.

Today's world is beginning to really strangle and stiffle differing and dissenting opinions despite the fact that freedom of speech is a core value that helped build the one of the greatest countries in the world. Whereas forcing conformity and snuffing out differing opinions has long been the tool of dictators and fascists.
