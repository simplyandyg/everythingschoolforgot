a series on all the things I would like Mikey to know and understand in life, especially should anything ever happen to me

Look into this writing framework more:
https://twitter.com/JustinSaaS/status/1486473719723831306?t=KDxXoi-XcuHRJjE07e-4Kg&s=19

For each topic, maybe I should be approaching it with the following framework:

* What is it? Why is it important? How do you do it?
* Biggest thing: given actionable points to make the advice easier to follow


What's the 1 percent?

* This is the 1 percent of the topic that the other 99% hinges on


What are the absolute most important things someone should know about life?

Letter to my kids:
I originally started this project to teach you so many of the things I have read about. I wanted to teach you things so that you could be successful. But that's not the most important thing in life. More than anything I want you to be happy, and more than that I want you to be content. I want you to live a life YOU can look at now and in 50 years and be happy with. I want you to be able to chase the things you want while also being grateful for and appreciating the things you have.

If you could only teach someone 5 things. What would you teach them?

Stop and smell the roses. Learn to appreciate what you have

- Sleep, exercise, diet
- Be open and vulnerable, but don't get walked on. Limit the numbers of times a single person can screw you over.
- Active Listening
- life is about relationships, not money - https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1460313930094555139?t=lOwPAMaC0c3_shRvA-_L7A&s=19
- avoiding materialism - minimalism to some extent
- always remember your not better than anyone else. Treat everyone with respect because at the end of the day you're still a parasitic spawn that fell out of your mother's vagina covered in slime and shit while flying on a space rock in a circle around a ball of fire. And there's trillions of those rocks and balls of fire. And your just the tiniest speck of dust in the sands of time and space. (Include other similar quotes)
- Take time to do things you enjoy no matter how "busy" you are. - leading into Essentialism. Strip away the things that are not important to you or your goals.
- Do the right thing
- Why doing the right thing can so often have difficult or hurtful consequences - why making people upset doesn’t mean you necessarily did the wrong thing - why often you can try to become a better person and it feels impossible because things keep going wrong and how to deal with it
- How to focus and really get things done and how hard work doesn't need to mean working all the time, but rather working hard during the allotted time
- It's very easy to get caught up in things that feel productive at least partly because we desire to be in a flow state
- Never let yourself live in fear - give lots of examples - fear of making people angry, fear your spouse will be upset with you, fear of failure, do not let fear rule your life
- How to balance perfection with production
- Meditate or at least time for your mind to relax and to wander. No screens, no music (unless calming), no input. Let yourself be calm and bored. Give your mind time to relax, especially in today's world
    - mindfulness and being able to learn to recognize how your body is feeling, and realize you do not have to react to whatever stimulus you have noticed such as someone screaming at you or your kid pulling on your arm. 99% of the time you can just breathe and it will be fine. If no one is in immediate danger then there's no need to react
    - mindfulness - allowing an emotion to take hold and pass without acting on it - Benedict carry
- Plan and be spontaneous at the same time
- Growth mindset
- Open-mindedness
- How do you define success? It should not be all about money. It should be much deeper than that. Life goals such as having time to relax and spending with friends and family. Maybe having a family. Meeting a person to spend your life with. Etc.
- Meta-cognition (thinking about how you think) and what mental models are, not necessarily any specific ones but just the concept
- Write to think deeply. Thinking a lot about something is not the same as thinking deeply. Thinking about something "a lot" doesn't mean a couple minutes here and there with only surface level thoughts. Work through the garbage to get to the good stuff. What questions to ask? Which decisions warrant deep thought? Use the following link's section on 6 ways to make better decisions for the "how" portion here https://newsletter.afabrega.com/p/fab-fridays-75-making-better-decisions?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=
    - should the above be part of an article on decision making? I think writing to think deeply has merit on its own aside from decision making. For things like therapy, introspection, learning, etc.
    - maybe simply reference it in a decision making article
- Don't be mentally lazy. We often over estimate the amount of effort and time required to complete relatively simple tasks while underestimating large ones (e.g. entire projects)
- better to sell forgiveness than ask for permission - obviously context matters
- Knowledge depth vs. Surface knowledge. Surface knowledge is something anyone can learn with a quick Google search. And today's world where the internet is everywhere surface knowledge is becoming less and less useful. Deep knowledge however is becoming more and more important and valuable. As is being able to make connections and insights across fields or disciplines often thanks to the deep knowledge one holds.
- Compounding
- Beginner's mind
- Deliberate practice
- Thirst for knowledge and a love of learning. Learn deeply on what interests you, the hell with whether or not someone thinks it is useful. There are very few subjects where a deep knowledge of it is useless and holds no value.
- How to be smarter?
- How to develop habits
- Strategic thinking? https://twitter.com/blakeaburge/status/1456977274159333386?t=NYdMfQsFpO5kS7_KtkyzZQ&s=19
- default to action - efficiency is the death of production and productivity - many spend so much time worry about the best or most efficient way to do something that they never get started https://twitter.com/wdmorrisjr/status/1451881131536617481?t=EVOg8gr_NE-aOalzzC0dfQ&s=19
- Thinking outside the box
- The law of averages - you don’t have to be exceptional every day, but if you are most days then you’re okay. You don’t have to have perfect sleep every night but if you do most nights, you’re doing good.
- make your own opportunities and don't wait for them to come to you. Ex: I have been waiting for better job offers and more complex work, but I should have going out to find both of those things. I could have been working on upgrading Laravel or fixing V3 or Workscopes on my own as a personal side project instead of expecting management to give me time. It's not about not doing work for free. It's about using that "free work" to build your skills and resume. And having a chance to drop your hard work directly into the hands of people who will use it every day
- we need to be grateful for all that we have and all the good in our life because it's 99.9% due to luck
- learn to stop saying you can't or you don't have time (when it's really just that you refuse to give up something else I. E. You won't give up TV to workout after work)
- learn to stop saying you "have to do X" when you don't have to. You're making a choice to because the alternative is either uncomfortable or you refuse to find one
- Very few things in general are absolutes. Stop thinking in absolutes
- Think in probabilities not absolutes - the above is more about stop thinking about life in black and white especially in relation to labeling people, but they do tie in along with the idea of keeping an open mind
- self reflection - related to below - an example of self-reflection is how I'm getting better at eating less sweets by really thinking about why I'm eating the sweets and if I'm hungry and if it really gives me as much satisfaction as I believe it does. Thinking my way through it I realized the reason I sit there and stuff my face with things like chocolate chip cookies is not only because they are delicious, But also because I believe that they are delicious and because I believed that I love to eat them. Which in turn I think makes me believe that eating them will make me happier. Which isn't necessarily the case. Or at the very least if eating one does boost my mood a little bit every subsequent cookie has diminishing returns on the happiness added. And even so the happiness is temporary. Because I end up being upset with myself that I've eaten so many empty calories especially when I'm trying to do a good job of staying in shape. And devouring 12 chocolate chip cookies is counter to that core goal. The feeling I get from staying in shape is much more important to me than getting a little bit of happiness from eating a bunch of chocolate cookies.
- most people aren't intentionally a-holes or bitches - most people are not thinking and that's the problem. Most people haven't ever questioned why they do and say things. They simply follow their impulses. They say the first thing that comes to mind. Maybe they're causing drama by saying something stupid about your spouse to make you jealous or mad at them simply because they get off on drama. Why do they get off on drama? Probably because it's an escape from their own bullshit. Or because it makes them feel better about their shit because it shows them others aren't perfect. But chances are if they thought about the dumb shit they said, they'd feel bad about it. I believe most people are good or want to be, but sometimes we develop bad habits. Sometimes it's our fault or sometimes they're things they were ingrained in us when we were growing up and we just have not realized it or reflected on it yet. It hasn't clicked. I've known things without really KNOWING them. For example, I always had trouble saying no to people. I kind of knew it on a subconscious level, but I never did anything about it because on a truly conscious level I had never thought deeply about it or confronted it. Not until recently when I realized I had trouble saying no to people and had trouble with confrontation from the aspect of saying something or doing something that someone wouldn't like because I was afraid to make them upset. Not because I was afraid to yell at or anything I don't care if people yell at me. But just from a weird ingrained fear of making people upset. I just don't like when people are upset I guess and that led me to being afraid to say no or being afraid to say things that would make people upset or uncomfortable. It took me a long time not only realize what was going on with myself but also to realize that it's okay if you say or do something that makes somebody upset. Just because someone got mad it doesn't mean that what you did was wrong. Oftentimes if you're doing what you really truly feel is best for you and the people you love and you aren't doing anything that's going to outright cause someone else harm and the people still get mad at you it's probably on them. It's probably an issue with them. And took me a long time to realize that because I had n't really been consciously aware of why I was acting the way I was acting.
    - this relates to empathy
    - How do you recognize these things? I think one way start recognizing them would be to look for situations and instances where you are uncomfortable or stressed or angry and maybe there's really no need for you to be. For example if you get overly stressed out when someone asks you if you want to hang out or if you get overly stressed out when someone asks you for a favor. Or if you get overly stressed out when your spouse says you're in-laws are coming over. When you find those situations start asking yourself why why are you uncomfortable why are you angry why are you upset. One reason could be you're not speaking up. Why do you say mean things to other people for no reason? Maybe it's because you feel like crap on a daily basis and misery loves company. The first step to changing these behaviors and getting better is to recognize them. And recognize the triggers. And recognize The why and the reason it's happening. Then go one step deeper and ask why do you feel like crap everyday. Use the five why's to get the base of the issues. If you feel like crap everyday because you're unhappy with some other aspect of your life. And what is that aspect what can you do to change that? Maybe you feel like you can't change that. Why do you feel like you can't change that?
- decision making - https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969269128962048?t=9RHmHUK78TrvU_C_BMgOUA&s=19
    - is this a decision that could change the course of my life? I.e. driving drunk
    - could other people be affected or hurt?
    - how will I feel about this decision and my choice 10 years from now?
    - thinking in probabilities
- different kinds of happiness - https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1458135135191138306?t=RUunPGyKjW8_akcSFjsGwA&s=19
- how to take criticism and advice
- balance your needs and wants with the needs and wants of others because if you plan on having kids, then they will and should become number 1, but until then don't let another's wants come before yours. It's okay to split 50/50 but if you are in a relationship and your partner's needs continually come before your own then you either need to reevaluate your relationship or have a friend discussion with your partner and figure out if a 50/50 split is doable or if you need to leave the relationship. Because there are a lot of things that likely you won't be able to do for years once you have the kids. And that's totally fine because having kids is great. But take chances and truly live life prior to having kids. People tell you to do this and they say to travel and they say to have fun, but they don't really explain that. Don't just travel go on adventures. Do things that you would never do if you had a 3-year-old with you. You wouldn't go skydiving with a 3-year-old attached to your hip. You wouldn't go on a 3-week track through the Appalachians with a 3-year-old. You wouldn't go on a week-long snowboarding hike with a 3-year-old. You wouldn't travel through Europe with no plan with a 3-year-old. These are the kinds of travel you should be doing. Yes going to a beach and sitting there for a week is amazing especially when you work all the time. But it's something that you can do with a 3-year-old. But maybe not that might be a good one to do too because with kids you're not going to just relax. And if you have a spouse who isn't into activities that you've really enjoy, it's okay to enjoy those activities without your spouse. If you loved going on rock climbing trips before meeting the person you're with, then it's okay to continue doing that once you are together. Now should you use all of your vacation time on rock climbing trips that they will not enjoy No. But if you have 2 weeks of vacation time of year I think it's okay to spend a week of that vacation time doing something you want and a week of vacation time doing something together. Because at some point you will have no choice but to do all your things together because you'll have kids and they will come first.
- prioritizing is the key to productivity
- be honest even when it is hard, including in telling people their flaws even in important relationships especially if it is something that when pointed out could help them be a better person or be more successful in other relationships
- most problems in our lives are our own fault one way or another
    - either we cause them, we let them happen, we don't say no to something, or we refuse to walk away or cut something out of our life
- learning that reframing something in your own mind is a possible and can be a powerful and helpful tool to have

**Pages to Create**
- create a principles, values, and observations page
    - https://mobile.twitter.com/sahilbloom/status/1456969261839228936
    - maybe include sayings and quotes in the above
    - simplicity in these things might really be more helpful than we realize. Things like patience and gratitude sound like overly simplistic words, but they are two key cores to profound relationships especially in terms of raising children and parenting.

* Growth Mindset
    * [https://twitter.com/schoolforgot/status/1385567467955752961?s=19](https://twitter.com/schoolforgot/status/1385567467955752961?s=19)
* Being open minded
* Thinking "a lot" is not the same as thinking deeply with singular focus
* "Keep digging" to find the best quality work you can produce
    * Write and then write and then write some more and then keep writing. This way you get all the garbage material out and then suddenly the great stuff will start flowing out (find who wrote the quote similar to this)
    * This quote translates to just about every other creative endeavors. Keep pushing, keep spewing our your ideas over and over until you hit the good ones
* Hard Work
    * Being smart isn't enough - I grew up believing it was because I was always told it was great I was so smart. That led me to believe if I didn't get something at first, I should just move on because I just wouldn't get it. I was so smart so it must not be my thing otherwise I'd get it. Also believed I should be paid well and succeed just for being smart.
    * Some people say “work smart” don’t “work hard”. They generally mean, use your head more and you can use your time less while still making the same if not more money
    * In my experience the “work smart” part really means, use your head to think in-depth about what you are doing. It is the in-depth thought in conjunction with action that makes the difference. You don’t want to be paralyzed by your thought, but if you are simply acting without reflection and deep, focused thought on the subject then I believe you end up in the “works hard but doesn’t get ahead” category. Keep in mind that “getting ahead” is subjective. And one person's success is not the same as another.
* Hacks, Quacks, and Bullshit
    * 5 minute fixes or get fit in a week and similar things are bullshit. Don't waste your time. Don't try to rush things
* Compounding (like interest)
    * Establishing routines
    * My daily routines
* Beginner's mind
* Education / learning / continual learning / thirst for knowledge
    * Slowing down to speed up
        * This applies to learning, sports, lifting, running, etc.
        * Slow is smooth and smooth is fast
    * How to be smarter
    * The difference between understanding and knowing/mastery
    * Don’t be a Cultist
        * Don’t allow yourself to be blinded by your admiration, love, friendship, etc
        * Do not blindly believe all the information you get from any one person or source
        * I’m applying this more to informational trust than to personal trust
        * Take everything you hear with a grain of salt, no one source is always right and unbiased
* Reading the source is important
    * Reading cliff notes or shortened versions of books is faster but not better (books are not the only source… sometimes it's a long well written blog post, podcast, etc)
    * It doesn't provide the reiteration of important ideas that happen in books and leads to those ideas sticking in your mind
    * Unless you have a really good system in place for learning
    * But even still, I think the source is important
* History repeating and society ignoring it
* Failure isn't failing - not learning from it is
* How to be smarter
* Deliberate Practice
* Value and Goal Setting
    * OKRs
* Productivity
* Focus
    * Define focus
    * What is it? Why is it important? How do you do it?
* Balancing focus and exploration/learning
* Prioritizing
    * 99% of the time people say "I don't have time", it means I don't want to do it and I don't want to make the time
* Mental models
    * Inversion - flip the way you're thinking about something
* Habits
* First Principles
    * [https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1371140133622222851?s=20](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1371140133622222851?s=20)
    * Socratic questioning
* Strategic thinking
    * Discuss the definition of this that has to do with overarching strategy and planning such as goal setting etc
    * Discuss the kind of thinking one can use to come up with a plan for how to succeed in the face of their failures.
    * For example if you continue to fail to develop a specific habit what can you do to make it work instead of just accepting that it won't? Ask yourself the following question: What would you tell someone else if they came to you for advice?
    * Oftentimes we have great advice inside of us but we are not good at expressing that advice to ourself and we are also generally not good at following that advice. However it is good to have techniques to be able to pull that advice out of us so that we can at least try to follow it.
    * Example: I am having trouble focusing on my goals. No matter what I do I just can't seem to get anywhere. There's always so much going on. So what would I tell someone else who is having this problem? I would probably say well where does your time go? Could you write down all the things you do in a day and not off the top of your head but rather as you do them. Are you looking at your phone 40 times an hour? Are you googling random things when you should be writing? How much time do you spend watching TV? How much time do you spend doing something else that maybe of little to no value especially when it comes to achieving your goals.
* Goal setting
    * Even if you don't want to improve and just want to live in the moment and enjoy life, setting goals can help clarify what you do want in life and how to avoid the things that will bring you down
* Sales
* Don’t fall into all or nothing thinking

**Creativity**



* Following your own path
* Thinking outside the box
* Don't be afraid to express your weird ideas
* Bending the rules
* Not always following the rules
* Rules were created by someone no smarter than you
* Asking questions and questioning the status quo
* Not being afraid to stand out and forge your own path
* It's okay if your "original" thoughts aren't so original
    * It's not always so much about the thought as how you came to the conclusion and recognizing the critical thinking that went into it.
    * Just because something is "unoriginal" doesn't mean it is not important and that everyone knows and understands it.
* Play

**Emotion**



* Empathy and Compassion
* Forgiveness vs. Holding a Grudge
* Staying calm and emotional control
    * [https://valerad.medium.com/the-anger-5d6e72773a18](https://valerad.medium.com/the-anger-5d6e72773a18)
* Stepping back / taking yourself out of a situation / seeing it from an outside perspective
* Imposter syndrome
    * Feeling insecure is fine and normal
* What if happiness is habit based?
    * We are stuck on the idea that we need multiple hours per day to sit in the couch and watch TV or post video games or spend hours on YouTube and our phones.
    * Yet somehow we "don't have time" for things like meditation, stretching, exercise, etc that are good for our mind and body
* Happiness
    * How do habits affect this?
    * [https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19](https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19)
* Learn to be introspective
    * So you can avoid lying to yourself - often if you are lying to yourself, it's not only affecting you - lying to yourself by making false gestures of kindness towards people (offering way after you know they'll say no) to make yourself feel good about not helping them out - or lying to yourself about an addiction
* Dependence and codependence
* Writing to remove "random" frustration
    * Sometimes we are in a bad mood and don't know why. Writing how and what we are feeling can help bring out the "why"
* It's Okay to Be Emotional (Emotions are not the Enemy)

**Nature**



* The importance and fragility of the environment and ecosystems
* A natural world untouched by man - what the physical world looks like when not paved over and built on

**Psychology**



* The mental boundaries we put on ourselves
    * Example: when you don't have kids, the feeling that you NEED to be home for you spouse even if you only go out once a week
* Motivation
* Habit Building
* Confirmation bias
* Incentives
* Bias and interpretation of the world
* Sunk cost fallacy
* Empathy deep dive
    * In depth explanation on how hard it is to judge others, we make mistakes too, we get tunnel vision, it can last seconds or years, we don't always make decisions or say things inline with our core values, I've said things and forgotten to later be told about them and it surprised me
    * Instead of saying things like "no one would ever think that way" or "no one would ever do that", we should think and say "what could cause a reasonable person to act that way" and give others the benefit of the doubt, at least the first couple of times
* Conspiracy theories and why people believe “crazy” things even if they aren’t “crazy”
* People rarely act with intention
    * Mostly act on instinct, emotion, and reaction
    * Not a well thought it plan
    * I doubt most abusive behavior is based on a week thought out plan - such as someone sitting down and planning out how to cut someone off from their family
    * Instead it is probably based on reaction after reaction due to jealous feelings instead of a grand sinister master plan
    * Probably think of a less sensitive example for the article

**Personal Finance**



* Budgeting
* Taxes
* Interest
* Credit Rating
* Credit Cards
* Loans
* Investing
* When all else fails, cut a deal (in hot water, heading to collections, or in collections? Tell them what you could comfortably pay, but that's all you can do, otherwise they can chase you)
* Need vs. Want - $1300 phone vs organic food

**Communication**



* Being clear (and concise)
* You don't owe most people an explanation

**Negotiating**



* Buying large items
* Buying a house
* Buying a car

**Zen**



* Gratitude
    * [https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19](https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19)
* Materialism
* Balance vs. Extremism
* Circle of life / how many of these principles are interdependent and intertwined
* Meditation
* 5-second memory, taking things at face value and avoiding assumptions (when taking & arguing with people)

**Misc**



* Avoiding information overload
* Time is the most important currency
    * Would you take $100 billion dollars if it meant you had to be 90 years old?
    * [https://twitter.com/Camp4/status/1346542428946239488?s=20](https://twitter.com/Camp4/status/1346542428946239488?s=20)
* Surface level knowledge is a waste of your time

**The way the world truly operates**



* Greed
* Big industries
* Conglomerates
* Big money politics
* Oligarchy vs democracy vs republic
* Media creating polarized opinions, pitting the every day people against each other
* Issues with capitalism, either we have a poor implementation with stocks etc or it is a fundamentally flawed economic system
* Consumerism/materialism - and how society is built around them instead of the common good/altruism. For thousands of years, society has been built on a class based system. Modern day problems that are for the common good or to help us in the future often have a very hard time getting funding and/or research because there is not direct or current or near future commercially viable product/service tied to it
* Don't underestimate the power of convenience. People will trade a whole lot to make things more convenient in the "now"
* Most people are average… and that's a good thing
    * Talk about the bell curve and how most people fall in the middle. Explicitly state what percentage of people fall within ex sigma. Then describe how the reason that's good is for things like politics and the way people act. And how this all applies to show that the crazy opinions and the crazy people we see in media and on the internet and going viral do not represent the vast majority of us. And the vast majority of us just want what we think is best we don't want to be bothered with other people's lives we just want to do what we want to do.

**Gratefulness Challenge**

This would be a 1-7 (or more I guess) day challenge where every time you get mad, you write why you're actually grateful for the thing that made you angry

Examples:

Mad you can't find your car keys - grateful you have enough stuff that you can lose your car keys, grateful you have a car at all

Your spouse left a mess on the counter - grateful your spouse is a generally awesome person to be around, grateful you have a roof over your head

You don't get the promotion at work - grateful that you have a job at all

The idea here was that I would post this to everythingschoolforgot.com and my twitter
