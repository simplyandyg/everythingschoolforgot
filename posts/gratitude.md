Something I've learned over the last few years, as I move onto the backside of my 30s is that gratitude is incredibly important. I'm going to do my best to provide you with a deeper and clearer explanation of the importance of gratitude in the hopes that you are able to fully grasp it's importance.

Gratitude is preached to many of us as we grow up, but it doesn't necessarily sink in (at least not fully). We often heard from our parents, "Do you know how many kids wish they have what you have?" Or "There are starving kids out there, you need to eat your food." I know that I've used that sentiment with both of you even though you're not even five years old yet, and you definitely do not understand it. Hearing things like this sunk in on a surface level. I always knew I was luckier than most in life for many reasons, but it was still easy to ignore so many things that I should have been more grateful for.

Someone once asked me, "So just because there are people worse off than me, I'm just supposed to be grateful and deal with it?" And if I recall correctly, at the time, I wasn't honest with this person or myself. I didn't say what I really believed, and instead molded my words so that they more closely resembled what they wanted to hear. (I've often had a bad habit of being a people pleaser and being afraid to say things others didn't want to hear, and this was one instance.) What I should have said was, "Pretty much. Look around you. The things in your life that you're unhappy about, are they causing you harm? Are you in danger? Are you uncomfortable? Are your needs not being met? Or is it simply your *wants* that are not being met?"

If you are in a situation where anything but the last question is true, then you likely have reasons to be unhappy, upset, and angry. And first and foremost you should work to get yourself into a better situation. But even still, there's probably things you could be grateful for. And ideally, once you're in a better place, being able to sit and reflect about the things that, prior to your bad situation, you may have taken for granted. And maybe try to avoid doing so in the future.

If you're in a situation where only the last question is true, and you find yourself more angry than happy, then maybe you need to stop and smell the roses. Take some time to reflect on how good you have it, and how lucky you really are. Think about all that you have to be grateful for.

In both cases, it's hard to sit down once and bring yourself to life changing insight. Instead, I suggest a gratitude practice. Pick a time each time, like right when you wake up, before a meal, or right before bed to right down 3-5 things you're grateful for.



A note on being in a bad situation:
If you are in a bad situation that you truly can't get out of, then gratitude may be very useful to you. Looking for things to be grateful for or things that you previously took for granted and would love to have again some day may help you to avoid true despair and to keep hope alive that things may one day be better again. I hope the two of you are never in this situation, but if you are, please don't lose hope. I love you both way too much for that. Please always know there are people who will be there for you, and that it will get better no matter how bad it is.

# Gratefulness and appreciation


# The balance of gratitude, ambition, and wanting more
The ability to be grateful for what you have while being able to drive yourself to reach for more. Not in a materialistic sense, but in the sense that advancement and pushing oneself to be better can often lead to a more fulfilling life as long as you understand that it's the means that are more important than the ends. It is the journey, the act of the pursuit, the learning, the doing, that lead to happiness and not necessarily the final result. It's not the money or the house that leads to happiness. It's the path you took. If you killed for that house, does that make you happy? If you worked hard for it, does that feel better? Probably it does. And the house may bring a feeling of happiness, but what makes you happiest about that house? Probably not that it's nice, although you may be proud that it is. But probably that it houses your family. It's a safe, comfortable place for them that makes you happiest.

I think you can be grateful for what you have and appreciate it while striving for more

I think the key is to not let the striving consume you to a point you can no longer appreciate what you have
