Maladaptive day dreaming. You can't do well in school because you have ADHD. You're not smart enough. You're fat. You're too slow. You don't put on muscle easily. You're not natually gifted in X, you should stop. You're just not a (insert sport here) player. You have X and that means you can do Y.

These days everyone wants to put a label on characteristics of people. Every little quirk is now some kind of ailment. There's something wrong with everyone.

Well, the funny thing is, it's not people that have changed. It's the labels. We've gone way overboard. Maybe it's okay to have names for everything. Maybe it's okay to say "I have this issue it's called". But it's not okay to be defined by those labels. It's not okay to feel lesser than because of those labels or to let anyone else make you feel less than.

When you're given a label or told you have something wrong with you or something that makes you different, it's up to you how you handle that. You can play the victim and say that you can't do X because you have Y. Or you can say "so what? So what if I have X. Why can't I do Y? Like what is ACTUALLY stopping me?" Often times the answer to that question is nothing. The only thing stopping you is your own thoughts and feelings that may or may not have been placed upon you by others. Sometimes, yes, there is a physical limitation or a safety reason why you shouldn't do certain things, but even in those times there's often a boundary to be bent or broken or some creative way to think outside the box to do the things that no one thought you could do. Just because something is hard, or harder for you than others, doesn't mean you can't do it. It doens't mean it's impossible.

I want to make sure that no matter what happens to you as you grow, that you never ever feel less than. That you never feel like you can't do something you really want to do because someone told you so - unless they told you so because it's unsafe, then you really need to think about it because there's probably a good reason! :)

No matter what labels you may or may not be given, it does not define who you are as a person or what you are capable of. Always remember that. You're amazing.
