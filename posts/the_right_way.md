The older I get, the more I realize "the right way" is often not nearly as important as we make it out to be

1) it's often just a matter of opinion
2) sometimes the "wrong way" is 90% as good, and that may be all you need

And sometimes there more than one right way

When we learn to accept these things, it helps start us down the path of being able to better understand people of different backgrounds and viewpoints

Maybe your way is best for you but may not be for others and that is okay
